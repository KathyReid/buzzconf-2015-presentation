# Introduction

### Welcome to country

I wish to begin by acknowledging the Wathaurong people of the Kulin nations, the traditional owners of the land on which we are gathered today. We pay our respects to the local people for allowing us to have our gathering on their land and to their Elders; past, present and future.

Thanks everyone for coming today, and a huge thanks to Ben and Rick for convening an event as amazing as Buzzconf.

# Overview

Firstly, I'd like to see a show of hands. How many people in the audience today come from a software development, programming or systems administration background? And you're familiar with the concepts of test-driven development, behaviour-driven development, continuous integration, continuous development?

Yep, OK, great.

And how many people here today come from a bio-sciences, medical, bioinformatics background?

OK, great.

Today we'll be talking around the convergence of these two disciplines. We will explore the evolution of computing platforms, and draw out key differences between the earlier platforms that have shaped approaches to development best practice.

We'll then move to discussing the human body as a development platform

# Evolution of computing platforms

## Early computers

This might seem counter-intuitive, but in order to look forward to the future of development platforms, I'm going to start by taking an historical perspective.


SLIDE: Betty Jennings and Frances Bilas working on ENIAC

As most people in the audience would know, early computing platforms  - from around the 1930s to the 1940s - were physically large, taking up entire buildings or floors of buildings. Here, we can see Betty Jennings and Frances Bilas working on an early computer called ENIAC - the Electrical Numeric Integrator and Calculator. Using vacuum tubes for logical processing, these platforms had a very large physical footprint.

SLIDE: The bug removed froma computer by Grace Hopper

Development was done by manually moving dials and levers, or physically plugging in different switches and registers together. The development process was laborious, manual - and subject to the vagaries of such a large physical footprint. Indeed, it was during the early days of computing that the term 'bug' was coined - from an actual bug. Development work would be halted by errors such as vacuum tubes overheating and needing to be replaced. Obviously, building new development platforms represented huge investment - and so these early computers were limited to the military and advanced academic institutions.

## Transistors and integrated circuits

In the 1950s and 1960s, the invention of the transistor and later, the integrated circuit reduced the footprint of computing platforms - at least slightly.The equipment took up half a building instead of a full one.

SLIDE: IBM 608

Development had progressed slightly, and instead of manual switches and registers, programmes were run on advanced technology, like punch cards.

SLIDE: Punch cards

However, development was still hindered by the physical nature of the work - programming with punch cards was laborious, precise, meticulous, and required significant rework in the event of an error. There weren't syntax checkers or integrated development environments for punch cards to check that the code was at least syntactically valid before being input into the computer.

The rise of integrated circuits helped to address this issue


# The body as a development platform

## Fundamental assumptions

I'd like to first of all explore some fundamental assumptions I make around the body as a development platform. This is sometimes called 'bio-hacking' or 'body-hacking'. This movement assumes that to augment the human body is a 'hack' - an act of volition that is somehow seditious or defiant, or contrarian. There is an element of doing something that is somehow not quite proper, or authorised. 

SLIDE: Ninja

That brings me to the first assumption;

* ASSUMPTION 1: If you can't open it, you don't own it.


SLIDE: Assumption 1

Which brings me to my next
