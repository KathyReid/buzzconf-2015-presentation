# Introduction

### Welcome to country

I wish to begin by acknowledging the Wathaurong people of the Kulin nations, the traditional owners of the land on which we are gathered today. We pay our respects to the local people for allowing us to have our gathering on their land and to their Elders; past, present and future.

Thanks everyone for coming today, and a huge thanks to Ben and Rick for convening an event as amazing as Buzzconf.

# Overview

Firstly, I'd like to see a show of hands. How many people in the audience today come from a software development, programming or systems administration background? And you're familiar with the concepts of test-driven development, behaviour-driven development, continuous integration, continuous development?

Yep, OK, great.

And how many people here today come from a bio-sciences, medical, bioinformatics background?

OK, great.

Today we'll be talking around the convergence of these two disciplines. We will explore the evolution of computing platforms, and draw out key differences between the earlier platforms that have shaped approaches to development best practice.

We'll then move to discussing the human body as a development platform

# Evolution of computing platforms

## Early computers

As most people in the audience would know, early computing platforms  - from around the 1930s to the 1940s - were physically large, taking up entire buildings or floors of buildings. Here, we can see Betty Jennings and Frances Bilas working on an early computer called ENIAC - the Electrical Numeric Integrator and Calculator. Using vacuum tubes for logical processing, these platforms had a very large physical footprint.

Development was done by manually moving dials and levers, or physically plugging in different switches and registers together. The development process was laborious, manual - and subject to the vagaries of such a large physical footprint. Indeed, it was during the early days of computing that the term 'bug' was coined - from an actual bug. Development work would be halted by errors such as vacuum tubes overheating and needing to be replaced. Obviously, building new development platforms represented huge investment - and so these early computers were limited to the military and advanced academic institutions.

## Transistors and integrated circuits

In the 1950s and 1960s, the invention of the transistor and later, the integrated circuit reduced the footprint of computing platforms - at least slightly.
